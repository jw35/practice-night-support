# practice-night-support

A web app for managing support for bellringing practice nights.

This is the code behind the AutoPerry service run by the [Cambridge District](https://cambridgeringing.info/) of the
[Ely Diocesan Association of Church Bell Ringers](https://www.elyda.org.uk/). The code itself is licenced under a 
permissive licence (see LICENCE.md). However if you are planning to reuse it the note that there's no
support for rebranding and you will have to work through all the templates (at least) to replace references to the 
Cambridge District and the Ely DA and to replace our branding. Please don't run this code anyere else under the name
AutoPerry.
